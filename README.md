Real Estate Web Application
A modern, responsive real estate web application built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project allows users to search, filter, and browse property listings for rent and sale. It features dynamic property details pages, responsive horizontal property sliders, pagination, and a clean, modular design.

Key Features
Property Listings:
Display property listings for rent and for sale using data fetched from the Bayut API via RapidAPI.

Filtering & Search:
Users can filter properties based on criteria like price range, number of rooms, and purpose (for rent or sale). Advanced search filters are available to fine-tune results.

Responsive Design:
A mobile-first approach ensures that property lists and sliders adjust gracefully to various screen sizes. On smaller screens, horizontal property rows allow intuitive scrolling.

Property Details:
Detailed pages for each property include image galleries, property attributes, and amenity details, all presented with engaging UI elements.

Performance Enhancements:
API rate limiting is implemented using Bottleneck, and the UI incorporates efficient client-side data fetching with conditional rendering.
